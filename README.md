## üìä Current Visualizations

Simulix offers a comprehensive suite of interactive modules, each crafted for exploration, experimentation, and learning:

- **Simulated Annealing ‚Äì Traveling Salesman Problem**  
  Visualize how simulated annealing efficiently solves the classic TSP by finding near-optimal routes through a set of cities. Adjust temperature schedules and observe the optimization process in real time.

- **Simulated Annealing ‚Äì Toy Example**  
  Build intuition for simulated annealing by optimizing a simple polynomial function. See how the algorithm explores the solution space and escapes local minima.

- **Alias Method**  
  Learn about the alias method for fast sampling from discrete probability distributions. Step through the construction and sampling process interactively.

- **Bootstrapping**  
  Experiment with statistical resampling. Use integer-only data, visualize the bootstrap distribution, and analyze bias and mean squared error (MSE) convergence with reference lines.

- **Huber M-Estimator**  
  Explore robust statistics using the Huber M-estimator. Adjust the tuning parameter, view the effect on estimator bias and variance, and toggle between linear and logarithmic scales.

- **Importance Sampling**  
  Understand the principles of importance sampling for variance reduction in Monte Carlo estimation. Adjust proposal distributions and observe estimator performance.

- **Random Forest Analyzer**  
  Visualize how random forests aggregate multiple decision trees. Explore tree diversity, feature importance, and the impact of ensemble size on predictive accuracy.

- **Bias-Variance Tradeoff**  
  Interactively explore the bias-variance decomposition. Adjust model complexity and sample size to see how bias, variance, and total error evolve.

- **Deep Reinforcement Learning Visualizer**  
  See how neural networks learn policies in reinforcement learning scenarios. Inspect weight matrices, activations, and the evolution of agent performance over time.

- **Neural Network Visualizer**  
  Build and train simple feedforward neural networks. Visualize layer activations, weight updates, and loss curves as you tune hyperparameters and train on sample data.
