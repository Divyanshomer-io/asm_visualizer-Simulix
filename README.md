# Simulix

Simulix is a gamified web platform designed to make applied statistical mathematics (ASM) concepts easy to understand through interactive visualizations. With Simulix, users can explore complex mathematical ideas and algorithms in an intuitive, hands-on way.

## Features

- Gamified, interactive learning for applied statistical mathematics topics
- Clear, dynamic visualizations with real-time feedback
- User-friendly controls for experimentation and exploration

## Current Visualizations

1. **Simulated Annealing – Traveling Salesman Problem**  
   Visualize how simulated annealing can help solve the classic Traveling Salesman Problem by finding efficient routes through a set of cities.

2. **Simulated Annealing – Toy Example**  
   Understand the basics of simulated annealing by optimizing a simple polynomial function, ideal for building foundational intuition.

3. **Alias Method**  
   Learn about the alias method for efficient sampling from discrete probability distributions, with step-by-step interactive guidance.

## Why Use Simulix?

- For students: Build intuition about statistical and mathematical concepts by experimenting with real algorithms.
- For educators: Demonstrate and explain ASM topics using engaging, visual tools.
- For anyone interested: Make learning statistics and mathematics more approachable and interactive.

## How to Use

1. Select a visualization from the homepage.
2. Use the provided controls (sliders, buttons, etc.) to adjust parameters and observe how the visualization responds.
3. Experiment with different settings to deepen your understanding of each concept.

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript/TypeScript (React or similar frontend framework)
- Modern visualization libraries (such as D3.js or Chart.js)
- Hosted on Vercel for seamless updates and fast performance
